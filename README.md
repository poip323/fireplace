fireplace.py

required:
python compiler or windows pc

please report any issues or exploits that the game has.

i will be updating the game as soon as a problem has arose.

i am still taking suggestions for the game itself, so if you have any suggestions for the game please comment them.

for mac users:
use the .exe file. but...
i suggest running Parallel Desktop. for this to happen you will need a windows product key.
